/**
 * 🔍 FIND EMPTY FOLDERS
 * 
 * WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
 * 1. Performs a non-destructive scan of the 'src' directory.
 * 2. Identifies and logs folders that contain zero files or subfolders.
 * 3. Uses a bottom-up traversal to find "chains" of empty folders 
 *    (e.g., if /a/b/c are all empty, it will identify all three).
 * 
 * WHY RUN THIS?
 * Use this as a health check to see how much "clutter" exists in your 
 * directory tree before running a destructive cleanup script.
 * 
 * SAFETY:
 * - READ-ONLY: This script does not delete, move, or rename anything.
 * - It will ignore the root 'src' folder even if it is empty.
